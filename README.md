# DeathNoteGame
I have created this game based on the popoular anime Death Note. 

It is still an early prototype, some changes need to be made to make the game
more fun and deceptive.

ABOUT THE GAME:

This game I have created is a social deduction game inspired by games like Mafia
and Secret Hitler, but with rules, plot and mechanics of Death Note.

The following are the rules for the game (subjected to change):

`RULES:

COMPOSITION:
8 players
1 kira
1 kira supporter 
6 agents, one of which is L

WIN CONDITIONS:

	TEAM KIRA WINS:
		L is killed without kira being his prime suspect.
		All the remaining agents are killed.
		Anyone except Kira is convicted.

	TEAM L WINS:
		Kira is convicted and is unable to identify L.
		Supporter kills Kira.

GAMEPLAY:
	Agents do not know other's identities except their own.
	Kira does know the identity of he supporter.
	Supporter does not know the identity of Kira.
	Kira cannot use the death note while the supporter can.
	The game begins with Kira passing a list of 6 agent aliases publicly.
  L gets to set his prime suspect.
	Supporter then kills one of the agents on the list.
	Then the night phase begins.
	A vote is taken and one person is detained by majority rule.
	The voted person is detained for the next day. 
	They can not vote or chat (or kill or send a list or investigate).
	Meanwhile in the night, L can choose to investigate one player and identify his role and Kira will make his list.
	Kira can choose to write a blank list, in which case the supporter will not kill the next day.
	Each time an agent is killed the list size is reduced by 1.
	Day phase begins again and another list is posted.
	The support can now either choose to kill from the list or not.
	And voting begins again for detention.
	At any day other than day 1, before the detention voting phase, any player can 
	propose to convict a player.
	Then the loop continues till the win conditions occur for either team.
	If Kira is convicted, he gets one chance to identify L, if correctly identified, Team Kira wins.`
